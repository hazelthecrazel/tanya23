<br><b>Rank:</b> Paige
<br><b>Height:</b> 5'6
<br><b>Weight:</b> 127 lbs.
<br><p align="center"><b>Detailed Information</b> <p align="left">
<br><b>Appearance:</b> A pair of baby blue sapphire gems set into porcelain fair flesh, they make up Tanya's striking gaze. Framing said special jewels are locks of deeper blue hair with a dyed gradient to a lighter, more electric blue which has the outwards appearance of being silky smooth and soft. Her hair is normally allowed to hang down to her hips, surrounding her hourglass shape and is sometimes styled into a high pontail. Tanya has slender, arched eyebrows that end into a fine point towards the ends, just enough distance apart to be equally spaced between her eyes and the bridge of her small and slightly upturned nose with dark blue dyed hairs to match her actual hair. Her lips appear as a rosy shade of pink, full and plush with a slightly bigger upper lip. Her overall facial structure is oval-like, her sharp jawline leading up into high, distinguished cheekbones that give her a more feminine face. She has narrow shoulders and wide hips that contribute to her hourlgass shape, long and slender legs accompanying them. There is one distinct tattoo on her left upper arm in a random shape, somewhat like a jagged snake design.
<br><br><b>Personality:</b> The Ivashkov girl has very powerful protective instrincts, unable to sit back and see people get hurt and will always try to do something to help wherever possible even if for a total stranger. She is extraordinarily devoted to helping innocent people and protecting those she loves. However, she can be very sarcastic and sharp-tongued at times, always having a smart ass comment whenever someone says something antagonistic to her and always bites back with a witty insult. She doesn't hesitate to speak her mind and can be extremely stubborn in her opinions.
<br>Despite these things, Tanya remains a social creature. She is normally friendly, warm, not shying away from new people, and she has considerable skill in social interactions. She has a certain charisma that attracts people to her and makes them flock to her, but there is a significant difference in this charm: it isn't due to her overall appearance, simply her witty sense of humor and her sharp brilliance.

<div id="tab1">
<br>Tanya Ivashkov was born to Adrian and Natasha Ivashkov in Moscow, Russia late one night in the European Medical Center (EMC) on January 18th. The pale blue-eyed girl was their only child, but her mother died during childbirth due to medical complications leaving her with only a resentful father as her ‘family.’ From that point on, for upwards of thirteen years it was just the two of them together. It took her father years to accept Tanya as his child, to forgive her for taking his wife in return for her own life in the world. The absence of a mother in her world left her to grow close to her Aunt Dalina over time, often staying the night at her house in times when her father was drinking. He had never taken his anger out on her before, but fear of that drove her to seek shelter there.
<br><br>On an early saturday morning, Tanya was sent out by her Aunt who was currently living there at the time as well as a few of her closer family friends to get groceries for the new years party they would be throwing that very night. Her instructions were clear: get drinks and snacks and return with the change. She did just that, but when she returned to her home the wooden door was kicked in, snow carried on chilling winds blowing straight through. The lights were still on, and she could see small blood stains on the windows. 
<br><br>Rushing inside, she came to the scene of every single one of her family members laying dead on the floor, their bodies nearly mutilated past recognition as their blood spilled across the wooden flooring. She felt her heart shatter at that very instant, blood roaring through her ears as tears streamed endlessly down her cheeks. She fell to her knees, emitting a piercing wail that woke up the neighbors who reportedly had heard nothing about what had happened to her family. Shockingly enough, no one did. It was if they had simply just died without a sound. Broken and traumatized, she was taken into custody by social services, and with no family to be handed off to she was shoved into an orphanage. 
<br><br>She spent weeks there, but one day an older married couple entered the orphanage and adopted her, taking her home with her with all of her meager belongings to a small village. The house was small, and quaint, but it smelled and felt like a home. Unknowingly to Tanya, the Russian Mafia often would make rounds throughout the town, taking money as payment for the villager’s lives, and she would have a run-in with them on a simple trip to get some bread from the bakery known for their delicious pastries and breads. That afternoon, while walking to the bakery, she was stopped by a car full of armed mafia demanding payments. She had absolutely no idea what they were talking about, and the only money she had to her name was the money given to her to pay for the bread. She didn’t have any other option, so she gave them all of her measly money and she was left there, right outside the doors of the bakery.
<br><br>Having seen this, the shopkeeper pulled her inside. She could tell that this bakery was also the person’s home, most likely run by their own family. The owner offered Tanya whatever she was coming to get, but for free since the mafia had taken her money. They too had been stolen from by them and they resented them for it, however.. They were kindhearted individuals and couldn’t stand to see the girl robbed. She had half a heart to object, seeing as how their income was their shop, but she needed the bread as well. Times were hard, and they needed what they could get. With a bag of bread in hand, Tanya began to exit when a flyer advertising a figure skating competition back in Moscow that was being held. Admissions weren’t expensive, so with a heart full of excitement, the young girl returned to her adopted home and begged to go. 
<br><br>Surprisingly enough, they agreed to take her, so week later, they set off back to Moscow. It was hard for her to be there after what had happened to her family, but excitement purged her dark thoughts and she managed to watch the show without thinking about it. One skater in particular, a girl named Vika Smirnov, was mentioned to have hailed from the very town she lived in! She felt her heart race, her jaw dropping. Once the show was over, she tugged her adopted parents all the way over to the Skaters’ booth where they could meet the skaters for a brief time. 
<br><br>Her excitement bubbled out of her like a boiling pot, and she couldn’t contain herself. Vika was a gorgeous woman, and her skating techniques were magnificent. Tanya has no hope of not barraging the woman with her questions. However, Vika took the questions in stride, and the two of them managed to form a quick and small bond over their conversation, and Tanya vowed to go to every single one of her games. 
<br><br>For three years she kept this promise until Vika Smirnov seemingly vanished off of the face of the Earth. Distrought, she looked everywhere for her, conducting hours upon hours of research. It was one of those days while she was researching that she recieved a letter from a place called ‘Ulreich University.’ She didn’t know what it was, or where, but in her heat she felt that she needed to go. She felt Vika’s presence there like a sharp tug on her soul. That very day, with all of her belongings, Tanya set off to the University. Hopefully there her and Vika could be reunited.
<br><br>They had lots of catching up to do after almost two years of not hearing from each other.

<br><b>Mana Manipulation</b>
<br>The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, and is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.
<br><br><b>What are Universal Spells?</b>
<br>Universal spells are spells taught by the teachers of Ulreich University that any mage can learn no matter their tree so long as their current rank is high enough to learn it.
<br><br><b>Personalized Mana</b>
<br>When mana is being weaved throughout Tanya's body, it takes on the form a medium toned purple flame that coils off from her skin like a fine mist and with no heat, ribbons of light blue intermixing with the purple like an intricate design. This is more prominent when spells like Show of Power are being used, and on its own it isn't too distracting, the colors more transparent than opaque. However, this aura becomes more opaque when more mana is being used, causing large-scale spells to cover her entire body, making her a beacon of purple and blue heat-less flames.
<br><i>- - - The color purple is generally associated with royalty and symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic.
<br>- - - Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. The color (light) blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness.</i>
<br><br><b><p align="center">Universal Spells </b><p align="left">
<b>Mana Weave</b>
<br>The simple act of weaving one's own mana pool through their body. Also known as channeling mana.
<br><br><b>Mana Spark</b>
A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.

<p align="center"><b>Enchantment</b><p align="left">
<i>The art of magical augmentation. Enchanters are able to infuse objects with their magic, granting the object a either a "Permanent" effect or boon, or a temporary ability which dissipates with time. Permanent enchantments must be recharged with the Enchanter's mana to keep these effects/boons active. As an enchanter increases in power, they not only gain acess to stronger enchantments, but are able to increase their durability and longevity.  Only non-biological/sentient objects may be enchanted.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Strong like Bear</b>
<br>The caster enchants a non-magical item no bigger than can be comfortably be held in one hand to bolster the holder's physical strength by 1.5x and may only be in effect so long as the object remains in physical contact with the caster. Leaving contact will cause the enchantment to cancel instantly and the spell also drains mana continuously until canceled. This enchantment may last for a maximum duration of two posts before automatically dispelling and going on a one post cool down duration.
<br><br><b>Russian Winds</b>
<br>When being moved through the air, the enchanted object ( which can not be too big to be held in one hand ) will begin to manipulate the air around itself to build up energy. Once enough energy has been built up over the course of two posts, the object will release an omnidirectional blast of cold wind which not only can knock back an average strength human a few feet, but is cold enough to cause mild chills and make wet objects almost freezing cold. After being enchanted and the item's ability is used, this enchantment fades away and goes on a two post cool down time before being able to be cast again on any object.
<br><br><b>"Davka" </b>
<br>A spell that has been affectionately named "Crush" when translated into the common language, this enchantment allows small handheld items to be thrown as projectiles and exponentially gain weight as they go. This allows for a greater punch when being hit, but certainly can not pierce through higher-grade materials than the object itself is. Objects with Davka cast on them gain an additional pound for every one foot they travel, up to a maximum of an extra fifteen pounds by traveling fifteen feet. Once the object leaves this fifteen foot area, the enchantment is instantly dispelled and the object loses all weight gained from being thrown.
