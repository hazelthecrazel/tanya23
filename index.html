<br><b>Height:</b> 5'6
<br><b>Weight:</b> 127 lbs.
<br><p align="center"><b>Detailed Information</b> <p align="left">
<br><b>Appearance:</b> A pair of baby blue sapphire gems set into porcelain fair flesh, they make up Tanya's striking gaze. Framing said special jewels are locks of deeper blue hair with a dyed gradient to a lighter, more electric blue which has the outwards appearance of being silky smooth and soft. Her hair is normally allowed to hang down to her hips, surrounding her hourglass shape and is sometimes styled into a high pontail. Tanya has slender, arched eyebrows that end into a fine point towards the ends, just enough distance apart to be equally spaced between her eyes and the bridge of her small and slightly upturned nose with dark blue dyed hairs to match her actual hair. Her lips appear as a rosy shade of pink, full and plush with a slightly bigger upper lip. Her overall facial structure is oval-like, her sharp jawline leading up into high, distinguished cheekbones that give her a more feminine face. She has narrow shoulders and wide hips that contribute to her hourlgass shape, long and slender legs accompanying them. There is one distinct tattoo on her left upper arm in a random shape, somewhat like a jagged snake design.
<br><br><b>Personality:</b> The Ivashkov girl has very powerful protective instrincts, unable to sit back and see people get hurt and will always try to do something to help wherever possible even if for a total stranger. She is extraordinarily devoted to helping innocent people and protecting those she loves. However, she can be very sarcastic and sharp-tongued at times, always having a smart ass comment whenever someone says something antagonistic to her and always bites back with a witty insult. She doesn't hesitate to speak her mind and can be extremely stubborn in her opinions.
<br>Despite these things, Tanya remains a social creature. She is normally friendly, warm, not shying away from new people, and she has considerable skill in social interactions. She has a certain charisma that attracts people to her and makes them flock to her, but there is a significant difference in this charm: it isn't due to her overall appearance, simply her witty sense of humor and her sharp brilliance.

<div id="tab1">
<br>Tanya Ivashkov was born to Adrian and Natasha Ivashkov in Moscow, Russia late one night in the European Medical Center (EMC) on January 18th. The pale blue-eyed girl was their only child, but her mother died during childbirth due to medical complications leaving her with only a resentful father as her ‘family.’ From that point on, for upwards of thirteen years it was just the two of them together. It took her father years to accept Tanya as his child, to forgive her for taking his wife in return for her own life in the world. The absence of a mother in her world left her to grow close to her Aunt Dalina over time, often staying the night at her house in times when her father was drinking. He had never taken his anger out on her before, but fear of that drove her to seek shelter there.
<br><br>On an early saturday morning, Tanya was sent out by her Aunt who was currently living there at the time as well as a few of her closer family friends to get groceries for the new years party they would be throwing that very night. Her instructions were clear: get drinks and snacks and return with the change. She did just that, but when she returned to her home the wooden door was kicked in, snow carried on chilling winds blowing straight through. The lights were still on, and she could see small blood stains on the windows. 
<br><br>Rushing inside, she came to the scene of every single one of her family members laying dead on the floor, their bodies nearly mutilated past recognition as their blood spilled across the wooden flooring. She felt her heart shatter at that very instant, blood roaring through her ears as tears streamed endlessly down her cheeks. She fell to her knees, emitting a piercing wail that woke up the neighbors who reportedly had heard nothing about what had happened to her family. Shockingly enough, no one did. It was if they had simply just died without a sound. Broken and traumatized, she was taken into custody by social services, and with no family to be handed off to she was shoved into an orphanage. 
<br><br>She spent weeks there, but one day an older married couple entered the orphanage and adopted her, taking her home with her with all of her meager belongings to a small village. The house was small, and quaint, but it smelled and felt like a home. Unknowingly to Tanya, the Russian Mafia often would make rounds throughout the town, taking money as payment for the villager’s lives, and she would have a run-in with them on a simple trip to get some bread from the bakery known for their delicious pastries and breads. That afternoon, while walking to the bakery, she was stopped by a car full of armed mafia demanding payments. She had absolutely no idea what they were talking about, and the only money she had to her name was the money given to her to pay for the bread. She didn’t have any other option, so she gave them all of her measly money and she was left there, right outside the doors of the bakery.
<br><br>Having seen this, the shopkeeper pulled her inside. She could tell that this bakery was also the person’s home, most likely run by their own family. The owner offered Tanya whatever she was coming to get, but for free since the mafia had taken her money. They too had been stolen from by them and they resented them for it, however.. They were kindhearted individuals and couldn’t stand to see the girl robbed. She had half a heart to object, seeing as how their income was their shop, but she needed the bread as well. Times were hard, and they needed what they could get. With a bag of bread in hand, Tanya began to exit when a flyer advertising a figure skating competition back in Moscow that was being held. Admissions weren’t expensive, so with a heart full of excitement, the young girl returned to her adopted home and begged to go. 
<br><br>Surprisingly enough, they agreed to take her, so week later, they set off back to Moscow. It was hard for her to be there after what had happened to her family, but excitement purged her dark thoughts and she managed to watch the show without thinking about it. One skater in particular, a girl named Vika Smirnov, was mentioned to have hailed from the very town she lived in! She felt her heart race, her jaw dropping. Once the show was over, she tugged her adopted parents all the way over to the Skaters’ booth where they could meet the skaters for a brief time. 
<br><br>Her excitement bubbled out of her like a boiling pot, and she couldn’t contain herself. Vika was a gorgeous woman, and her skating techniques were magnificent. Tanya has no hope of not barraging the woman with her questions. However, Vika took the questions in stride, and the two of them managed to form a quick and small bond over their conversation, and Tanya vowed to go to every single one of her games. 
<br><br>For three years she kept this promise until Vika Smirnov seemingly vanished off of the face of the Earth. Distrought, she looked everywhere for her, conducting hours upon hours of research. It was one of those days while she was researching that she recieved a letter from a place called ‘Ulreich University.’ She didn’t know what it was, or where, but in her heat she felt that she needed to go. She felt Vika’s presence there like a sharp tug on her soul. That very day, with all of her belongings, Tanya set off to the University. Hopefully there her and Vika could be reunited.
<br><br>They had lots of catching up to do after almost two years of not hearing from each other.

<br><b>Mana Manipulation</b>
<br>The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, and is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.
<br><br><b>What are Universal Spells?</b>
<br>Universal spells are spells taught by the teachers of Ulreich University that any mage can learn no matter their tree so long as their current rank is high enough to learn it.
<br><br><b>Personalized Mana</b>
<br>When mana is being weaved throughout Tanya's body, it takes on the form a medium toned purple flame that coils off from her skin like a fine mist and with no heat, ribbons of light blue intermixing with the purple like an intricate design. This is more prominent when spells like Show of Power are being used, and on its own it isn't too distracting, the colors more transparent than opaque. However, this aura becomes more opaque when more mana is being used, causing large-scale spells to cover her entire body, making her a beacon of purple and blue heat-less flames.
<br><i>- - - The color purple is generally associated with royalty and symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic.
<br>- - - Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. The color (light) blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness.</i>
<br><br><b><p align="center">Universal Spells </b><p align="left">
<b>Mana Weave</b>
<br>The simple act of weaving one's own mana pool through their body. Also known as channeling mana.
<br><br><b>Mana Spark</b>
<br>A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.
<br><br><b>Mana Parry</b>
<br>In a complicated set of movements, the caster must create a solidified pane of mana upon an appendage or object, and swipe it against an incoming projectile. Upon contact, the caster has a split second to match their mana levels with the opposing spells, which causes the projectile to meld with the casters mana and remove all secondary effects from the energy. This causes the spell to fly off in a random direction, reverted to base mana but still powerful enough to do damage based on the rank of the attack. Casters who use this can only do so on spells of their rank and below, and to do so costs the exact same amount of mana as the spell in question, so one should keep this in mind before parrying anything. Projectiles that have special effects such as detonation, or abilities that can be triggered mid flight can be activated before a spell is able to be parried.
<br><br><b>Mana Pane</b>
<br>When focusing one's mana before them and swirling it in a vortex quickly and violently, one may allow their mana to harden, causing a thin pane to form. This spell can only be used defensively and the power it can block is minimal, ranking at iron toughness. This spell can be learned by anyone of mage rank and above, but upon reaching high mage, one may cast two of these at a time, one for each hand.

<p align="center"><b>Conjuration</b><p align="left">
<i>"Conjuration is the art of summoning objects to one's self for their own use. These objects will return to the storage dimension in which they came from after usage. These objects also may possess a very wide array of special properties, and may even be controlled telepathically by the Conjurer once a certain mastery has been achieved."</i>
<br>
<br><b>Rifle</b>
<br>A standard portable long-barreled firearm about four feet in length designed for precision shooting, the Rifle conjuration is capable of shooting singular shots of two inch long bullets which are all (including the rifle itself) iron in strength. These bullets travel at a sprinting speed and may pierce through iron constructs. Anything higher than that will cause the bullet to simply smash into itself and flatten due to its speed and render it useless. Hitting surfaces below the bullets penetration level will still damage the material to a slight degree. The size of the bullets are very small, meaning breaking through a barrier will only penetrate the barrier in that diameter of size, and not rip the thing apart entirely. The bullet can only KEEP going past the barrier if its a rank above, as being the same rank will destroy that part of the barrier, but also the bullet. There is no need for this weapon to be “reloaded” but about a second must pass between shots, giving it time to charge its energy and fire. The bullets themselves are bright, glowing mana which can easily be seen and telegraphed. Upon Expert Mage rank this gun and its bullets scale to cobalt in durability. If Tanya weaved her mana into a singular bullet for one full post rotation, this bullet will gain strength enough to pierce through up to one rank above her current but will still be unable to fully destroy a barrier, simply damaging the area around impact and the bullets overall may travel up to thirty feet.
<br><br><b>Red-light Tracker</b>
<br>Able to be attached to the sides of the barrel of her Rifle, the trackers release a thin red beam of light like a laser pointer, each beam at an inverted angle to coalesce on a single point in the distance. This tracker will show the potential path of the bullets from her Rifle, the singular dot at the end of the foot long beams signifying where it would hit at a maximum range of 30 feet. The tracker is activated by a continuous stream of mana from her body, draining a small amount of mana once per post but makes the rifle shots far more accurate specifically on still targets. I.E. If a shot was intended to put a hole through a wall, doing so from 30 feet without the tracker would be iffy, but with the tracker the bullet will hit whatever the dot touches. The attachment itself is iron, scaling to cobalt by expert. If the tracker is destroyed it will not change the accuracy of any bullets already fired prior to its destruction. As long as the red dot remains on the target for a handful of seconds, the next projectile cast may track this being for the first 20 feet of its 30 maximum range. The speed at which the projectile tracks is rather slow, and can be outwitted by a fast individual assuming they have time to react. If the projectile passes a 20 foot range, the tracking will cease, causing it to continue flying in the same direction it was last heading towards. If the projectile in question has a smaller range than 20 feet, it will simply disperse upon passing that limit. 
<br><br><b>Cushion Boots</b>
<br>A pair of leather boots reinforced with iron  around the soles and the toes. Underneath the iron platings beneath the soles are lightweight airy cushions that expand when no pressure is current so that air can fill the tiny holes within and make a cushion of sorts. When pressure by the body weight is applied the cushions sink in a way that allow for quite a large amount of force to be applied to them before actually damaging the body from falls. I.E. 20 feet of falling would warrant no damage assuming she lands perfectly on her feet, but landing haphazardly (due to rushing, or being knocked down) will not trigger these boots at all. If mana is weaved into the boots prior to fall (cannot be done while falling) the limit in which she can fall without injury is 25 feet. At the cost of more mana, the air particles which move inside the boots while falling can be released in a blast of air pressure. This blast occurs around the bottom of the boots and can only shoot Tanya as far as she fell, so if she fell 25 feet in total, she’d fly forwards 25 feet in the direction she aimed her body. The blast of pressure will only damage up to iron assuming she has fallen at least 20 feet.
<br><br><b>Grappling Hook</b>
<br>A small metal attachment that wraps around Tanya’s forearm and is secured by metal clasps. When activated by feeding mana into it, the iron-grade attachment shoots out a long cable of equal durability at a sprinting speed in a straight line. This cable is capable of extending thirty feet and at the end of the line are three iron-grade claws that dig into whatever they hit so long as it is equal to or less than iron in strength to secure it in place. By feeding more mana into the cable itself it will begin to retract, capable of pulling an average-sized human towards the point of impact at the speed of which someone could overhand throw a decently weighted object. More weight can be pulled by the cable so long as it does not exceed 1.5x Tanya’s own weight. If this weight is passed then the cable will snap and will require to be reconjured before being able to be used again. Even without too much weight the cable can easily be broken by an attack of iron strength just as the metal forearm attachment can be.
<br><br><b>Refractive Barrier</b>
<br>An iron-grade (scaling to cobalt at expert mage) circular shield big enough to cover the mid-section of an average-sized person constructed of a highly reflective metal which may defend against a spell of equal ranking but will be destroyed. When destroyed the barrier may simply be reconjured.. If mana is actively being weaved into this barrier it may absorb one spell at least one rank below the rank of the shield and store the energy on its surface. After absorbing the spell, she may fire off a kinetic blast within three posts of catching it and the projectile will travel for 15 feet in a straight line through the front of the shield, and will ALWAYS be the same rank as the shield itself (for example, if she is expert mage and she absorbs a paige spell, she can still fire off an expert mage blast of kinetic force). For every rank higher her counter attack is in comparison to the attack she absorbed, she must expend more mana to power it up. If she defends against a beginner mage attack at mage, she will only have to pay a little mana to fire off a mage counter attack, but if a paige spell is absorbed she’ll have to pay more mana before firing it off. Once the projectile is fired it goes on a three post cool down before being able to be used again.

<p align="center"><b>Stigmatism</b><p align="left">
<i>"Stigmatism is the art of creating Auras around your body based on spirits that you form a close connection to. Stigmatism auras are generally related to an animal, and take on its properties (for example, a Hawk aura would grant increased vision, and faster movement), but they can take on the form of legendary human spirits as well. Each spirit that you use to create an aura from must be attached to the physical world via items that the mage holds on their person. You gain acess to one aura at paige, and an additional aura every rank (Your free spells are used to upgrade these auras). This consists of four regular spirits, two enhanced spirits (magical beings, more legendary warriors), and two epic spirits, which are gained at High mage, and High mage + respectively."</i>
<br><b>Falcon Aura</b>
<br>An aura that is able to be activated through a small bracelet owned by Tanya with a small feather of a Red-footed Falcon, a native bird from her homeland. This bracelet is constructed of a simple thick tin-grade leather strap wrapping around the wrist with several beads and a dark grey feather laced into the leather through a series of threads woven into the feather’s barb. Falcon’s aura wraps around Tanya’s back, manifesting itself as a solid pair of ethereal blue wings with a wingspan of ten feet and fluctuates in brightness depending on how much mana is weaved into the aura. The aura itself grants the following effects: 
<br><br><i><b>Flight</b></i>: When activated, the wings formed are capable of providing Tanya with a basic gliding ability. These wings may carry Tanya at the speed of which a base human can run as a simple glide but can not exceed this speed. She may activate this gliding ability so long as she stays within ten feet of the nearest platform capable of holding her. This means that if she falls from fifty feet, the wings will not work until she hits the ten foot mark. Upon reaching mage rank she automatically unlocks the ability of basic flight and her maximum height increases to fifteen feet.
<br><b><i>Feather Barrage</b></i>: By weaving mana into one of the aura’s ethereal feathers -- at a maximum of one at a time ( which scales by 1 extra feather per rank up to a maximum of four at mage rank )-- they will shoot out as projectiles, covered in a tin-durability outer shell of mana that hugs the feather’s form and causes it to glow a dull purple shade with a light blue core. Upon coming into contact with a solid object the outer shell will be capable of breaking through objects of tin durability but will also consume the feather and cause it to disappear. These feathers may travel at a maximum distance of ten feet and may be shot in a straight line, unable to be controlled past that point. 
<br><b><i>Winged Defense</b></i>: Wrapping the wings around herself like a shield, these wings may have mana weaved into their entire form to completely cover it in a tin-grade outer shell, effectively blocking up to one magical or physical attack of paige ranking, anything higher than that simply cracking through the defenses with ease. This ability goes on a two rotation cooldown after being used, and scales down to one rotation upon reaching Mage.
<br><b><i>Falcon Eye</b></i>: Weaving her Aura into her eye for 1 post allows her to see through one minor paige-ranking deception as well as doubling her farsight for a maximum duration of two posts which allows her to see details clearer from a greater distance (1.5x base human distance capabilities.). While this ability is active light-based spells and bright flashes are twice as effective on her which also doubles the range at which flashes of light can affect her.
